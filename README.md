# Camp (FORGE)

This project represents the FORGE camp landing site. The Preparation action now opens the Notion page directly in a new tab.

Quick notes

- The Preparation button links directly to: `https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-Notion-2e83bc82f50780eba66ec6acac7e17e2?t=new` (opens in a new tab).
- A previous Notion API proxy that fetched blocks server-side has been removed from the repository in favor of the simple direct link.

If you'd like the server-based integration restored (to render Notion inside the site), I can re-add it, implement richer rendering, or deploy a proxy for production.
